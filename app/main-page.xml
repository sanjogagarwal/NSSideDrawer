<!--
The markup in NativeScript apps contains a series of user interface components, each
of which NativeScript renders with a platform-specific iOS or Android native control.
You can find a full list of user interface components you can use in your app at
https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/components.
-->
<Page xmlns="http://schemas.nativescript.org/tns.xsd" navigatingTo="navigatingTo">
    <ActionBar class="actionBar">
        <!-- 
        Use the NavigationButton as a side-drawer button in Android
        because ActionItems are shown on the right side of the ActionBar
        -->
        <NavigationButton ios:visibility="collapsed" icon="res://menu" tap="onDrawerButtonTap"></NavigationButton>
        <!-- 
        Use the ActionItem for IOS with position set to left. Using the
        NavigationButton as a side-drawer button in iOS is not possible,
        because its function is to always navigate back in the application.
        -->
        <ActionItem icon="res://menu" 
            android:visibility="collapsed" 
            tap="onDrawerButtonTap"
            ios.position="left">
        </ActionItem>
        <Label text="Browse"></Label>
    </ActionBar>
    <!--
    The StackLayout stacks UI components on the screenâ€”either vertically or horizontally.
    In this case, the StackLayout does vertical stacking; you can change the stacking to
    horizontal by applying a orientation="horizontal" attribute to the <StackLayout> element.
    You can learn more about NativeScript layouts at
    https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/layout-containers.

    These components make use of the NativeScript core theme, which styles them with element selectors.
    The theme also provides a set of helper class names such as p-20, h1, h2, and text-center to enhance styling.
